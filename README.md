
# Network Sniffer with Real-Time Alerts and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is a network sniffer application built with Python, Flask, and Kafka. It captures network traffic, analyzes it using machine learning models, and sends real-time alerts when malicious activity is detected. The sniffer is containerized using Docker, and a Flask web server is used to provide a frontend interface for monitoring. This project is fully open source as well for as I don't like to believe that something like this should be hidden behind an invisible wall.

## Features
- **Network Traffic Capture**: Captures packets from network interfaces.
- **Machine Learning**: Uses a Random Forest Classifier for detecting malicious traffic.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends alerts through WebSocket when malicious traffic is detected.
- **Kafka Integration**: Real-time event streaming for processing network traffic.
- **Web Interface**: Built with Flask for displaying real-time alerts and status.
- **Dockerized**: All components are containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- Libraries: `psutil`, `scapy`, `flask`, `flask-socketio`, `kafka-python`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`, `psycopg2`

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-sniffer.git
cd network-sniffer
```

### 2. Build the Docker Containers
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Then, from the root of your project, build and start all services by running:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build and start the containers for the sniffer, web server, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Zookeeper.

### 3. Access the Web Interface
Once the containers are up, the Flask web server will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. You can monitor the real-time alerts generated by the network sniffer on this page.

### 4. Stopping the Containers
To stop all services, run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 5. Dockerfile Details
- **Sniffer Dockerfile**: Contains instructions to build the sniffer container, install necessary dependencies, and run the `sniffer.py` script.
- **Web Dockerfile**: Contains instructions to build the web server container and run the Flask app.

### 6. Customization
- **Network Interface**: The sniffer runs on the `eth0` interface by default. You can change this in the `sniffer.py` script or via environment variables.
- **Kafka Configuration**: If you need to adjust the Kafka configuration (e.g., change the bootstrap server), you can do so in the `send_to_kafka` function.

## Usage

### Network Sniffer
The network sniffer will automatically start capturing packets and analyzing them using the machine learning model. If malicious traffic is detected, an alert will be sent to the Flask web server.

### Real-Time Alerts
The web server listens for alerts from the sniffer and displays them in real-time via WebSocket. You can view these alerts on the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`.
